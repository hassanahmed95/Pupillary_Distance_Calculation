# Pupillary_Distance_Calculation
A project of Computer Vision, which have been developed to find the distance between pupils in real time. In the
development of the project, computer vision libraries OPENCV and DLIB has been used. That application uses credit
card as a marker (which is placed on face) in order to estimate the pupillary distance. The mean error rate of application
is up to 3.0 mm.
